CST 615 Final Project

Code written by Terin S Housey

To run the CST 615 Code, you will need to have Python installed. Then, you can double-click to open it in Command Prompt.

To run the CST615Final.exe, you should be able to double-click on the file to run it.

The file should not automatically close once it is ran. You should see "Press ENTER to close". At that point, the entire window should close.
