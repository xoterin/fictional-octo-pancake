CST 615 Final Project
Group 7 - Implementing DES Encryption and Decryption
Code written by Terin S Housey

Option 1:

To run the 'G-7_DES CODE', you will need to have Python installed. The code was written on version 3.9.4, which can be downloaded from https://python.org.
Once you have installed version 3.9.4 of Python, double-click the 'G-7_DES CODE' file to execute the application. This version is compatible with MAC OS and Windows.

Option 2: A Windows Executable file was created, but could not be uploaded to BlackBoard due to an UNSUPPORTED FILE TYPE error. It can be downloaded from https://github.com/xoterin/fictional-octo-pancake

The 'CST615Final.exe' can only be ran on Windows. In order to run the executable, double-click the 'CST615Final' file. This will place the Python files in a temporary folder on your PC and execute the application. NOTE: This Windows executable is UNSIGNED, so the publisher is Unkwown. In the event that Windows blocks the file, please click on "More Info" and choose the option to Run Anyway.

INSTRUCTIONS:

The application was tested using Example 4.3 from the textbook (page 113).

Plaintext: 02468aceeca86420
Key: 0f1571c947d9e859

Expected Ciphertext Result: da02ce3a89ecac3b

Step One: Enter a 16 character plaintext (character range: A-F, 0-9 - not case sensitive) and press ENTER
Step Two: Enter a 16 character key (character range: A-F, 0-9 - not case sensitive) and press ENTER
Step Three: Review the results to verify the encrypted ciphertext and decrypted plaintext
Step Four: Press ENTER to close the application

------

Additional Notes:
The file should not automatically close after running. You should see "Press ENTER to close". After pressing ENTER on your keyboard, the entire window should close.

On Windows, the file will close if the plaintext or key is not compatible. On Mac, you should receive a key error.
